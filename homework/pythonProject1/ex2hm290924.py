2 Error handling:

a. Explain what except-try does?

Answer:Try is used to check on the code that may make an exception, this will avoid errors and allows the code
to continue.
When 'Try' finds an error on the code this is moved to 'except', this feature can be used to find other exceptions.

b. b. Explain why you should "catch" the Python errors?

Answer: Preventing and checking for possible errors will improve the quality of the code!

# c. Write a piece of code that divides the number 88 by zero, then wrap it in an except try




# d. Write a piece of code that raises for error, then wrap it in except try
# e. Create a list of numbers of length 4 and insert any numbers into it
# Write a loop that receives a number from the user until the user enters minus 999
# i. Each time print the list member at the entered index
# (For example, if the user entered 0, print the member at index 0)
# ii. Wrap the code in except-try so that if the user enters a letter, or an index not
# in the range - then the plan will not fail
# Add to except a print that explains what the error was (see code from the lesson)
